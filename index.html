                    From Generation to Generation God has being raising Ministers or Leaders to be His Mouth Piece. Like
                    Abraham, Noah, Moses, Elijah, John the Baptist and the rest.
                    They are to warn his loving people about His ordinances so that they will be free from sin and His
                    wrath in order to have a cordial relationship with Him. Also to be free from Satan and his cohorts,
                    to be free from the world systems, to be free from the fresh (the human nature) i.e. it's lustful
                    desires, as well as to be free from manipulations and bondages of all kinds. All the God's Generals
                    did their best to carry out their assignments, but their results were not very successful, the veil
                    was still there.
                    God finally send Jesus Christ through the virgin Mary who came in the form of man and finally
                    perfected this redemptive work of salvation for mankind to just key in.
                    Jesus having completed the mission commanded us to continue the work. Matthew 28:19-20, Mark 16:16.

                <p class="paragraph">
                    During the Apostolic era, the work was really great and tough but was taken and done in truth/love
                    with sincerity, seriousness and urgency by the Apostles through the Grace of God that is available
                    in Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. In regard to the work, Apostle Paul said ‘’And He Himself gave
                    some to be the Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors and Teachers, for equipping
                    till we all come to the unity of the Son of God, to a perfect man, to the measure of the fullness of
                    Christ no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the
                    trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of a deceitful plotting, but speaking the truth in love…”
                    Ephesians 4:11-16.

                    But today the church and the society is still filled with a lot of evil people and lots of problems
                    that seems too difficult beyond human ability. Some of the followers of Jesus Christ who are
                    supposed to be the solution are also affected with these evil and problems. Sin is still reigning
                    among the so called Christians. Some Ministers in the body are blaming the members, while the
                    members are in turn putting the blame on the Ministers. One of the Church Father viewed something
                    like that when he said, “Let us then quit the old self and the habit that went with it, as sharers
                    now in the birth of Christ, let us break with deeds of flesh. O Christians, know your dignity, it is
                    God’s own nature that you share, do not then, by an ignorable life, fall back into your former
                    baseness. Think of the head, think of the body of which you are a member. Recall that you have been
                    rescued from the power of darkness and have been transferred to the light of God, the kingdom of
                    God.
                    …do not by evil deeds drive so great an in dweller away from you, submitting yourself once more to
                    the slavery of the devil. For you were bought at price of Christ Blood” Pope Leo the great.
                    “The smoke of the devil has entered the Church, let us open the windows of the Church for fresh air
                    to come in” Pope Paul VI lamented.

                    The Church has been praying for long, “Come, Holy Spirit fill the hearts of the faithful" These are
                    proves that the Church is sick. The condition of the Church best suits the parable Jesus gave about
                    an enemy who went by the night and planted tares among the wheat. Matthew13:24-30. The Church is now
                    mixed up with the wheat and the tares. Some of us where like the tares, living at the mercy of the
                    enemy, the world and human nature, until Christ found us and we agreed with him and he purified us
                    very clean from the mess. We are Christians from different backgrounds and denominations with a
                    vision of Christ for you, to bring you to his fullness. We believe in United we stand, divided we
                    fall! Mother Theresa of Calcutta once said “I can’t do it alone, together we can do great things”.
                    that is the power of unity. A denomination can do what the other one can not do, but together, great
                    things can be done.

                        If you have heard about Jesus Christ and you want to surrender your life totally to Him, you are
                        also welcome.
