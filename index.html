        <p class="paragraph">
            From Generation to Generation, God has been raising Ministers or Leaders to be His Mouthpiece. 
            Like Abraham, Noah, Moses, Elijah, John the Baptist, and the rest. They are to warn His loving people about His ordinances so that they will be free from sin and His wrath in order to have a cordial relationship with Him. 
            Also, to be free from Satan and his cohorts, to be free from the world systems, to be free from the flesh (the human nature), its lustful desires, as well as to be free from manipulations and bondages of all kinds.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            All God's Generals did their best to carry out their assignments, but their results were not very successful, and the veil was still there. 
            God finally sent Jesus Christ through the Virgin Mary, who came in the form of man and finally perfected this redemptive work of salvation for mankind to just key in. 
            Jesus, having completed the mission, commanded us to continue the work. (Matthew 28:19-20, Mark 16:16).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            During the Apostolic era, the work was really great and tough, but it was taken and done in truth and love, with sincerity, seriousness, and urgency by the Apostles, 
            through the Grace of God that is available in Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit. 
            In regard to the work, Apostle Paul said:  
            “And He Himself gave some to be Apostles, some Prophets, some Evangelists, some Pastors, and Teachers, for equipping till we all come to the unity of the Son of God, to a perfect man, 
            to the measure of the fullness of Christ no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of men, in the cunning craftiness of deceitful plotting, but speaking the truth in love…” (Ephesians 4:11-16).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            But today, the church and society are still filled with a lot of evil people and numerous problems that seem too difficult beyond human ability. 
            Some of the followers of Jesus Christ, who are supposed to be the solution, are also affected by these evils and problems. 
            Sin is still reigning among the so-called Christians. Some Ministers in the body are blaming the members, while the members, in turn, are putting the blame on the Ministers.

        <p class="quote">
            One of the Church Fathers viewed something like that when he said, 
            “Let us then quit the old self and the habit that went with it, as sharers now in the birth of Christ, let us break with deeds of flesh. 
            O Christians, know your dignity, it is God’s own nature that you share, do not then, by an ignoble life, fall back into your former baseness. 
            Think of the head, think of the body of which you are a member. Recall that you have been rescued from the power of darkness and have been transferred to the light of God, the kingdom of God.  
            …do not by evil deeds drive so great an indweller away from you, submitting yourself once more to the slavery of the devil. 
            For you were bought at the price of Christ’s Blood” – Pope Leo the Great.
        </p>
        <p class="quote">
            Pope Paul VI lamented, “The smoke of the devil has entered the Church, let us open the windows of the Church for fresh air to come in.”
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph">
            The Church has been praying for a long time, “Come, Holy Spirit, fill the hearts of the faithful.” These are proofs that the Church is sick. 
            The condition of the Church best suits the parable Jesus gave about an enemy who went by the night and planted tares among the wheat (Matthew 13:24-30).

        <p class="paragraph">
            If you identify yourself as a wheat among the tares, then you are welcome.  
            If you want to repent from your sins, you are also welcome.  
            If you have heard about Jesus Christ and you want to surrender your life totally to Him, you are also welcome.  
            If you want to serve the Lord Jesus according to this vision, then this is your opportunity.
